# TTrackerDemo
This is a sample project. The requirements are as follows.

1. Code should be hosted on GitHub, BitBucket, or TFS.
2. The basic idea for this application is to track "tickets" for issues in a fictional software application.
3. This should be a Web Application backed by a SQL database. (Please utilize .NET MVC and SQL Server)
4. You will need a screen to display all the "Open/Active" Tickets.
5. Tickets should be sortable by Severity, Date Created, and any other columns of your choosing.
6. When Tickets are marked as "Resolved", they should automatically fall off of the Open List.
7. You should be able to view Resolved Tickets as well (on the same screen or a different one, your choice).
8. There should be User Accounts and Roles.
9. Only Users with an Admin Role can Edit the state of the Ticket.
10. Any User can create a Ticket.

Upon login the ticket links will become visible and accessible to the current user.
